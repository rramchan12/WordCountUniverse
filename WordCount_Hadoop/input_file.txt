Else you must be ready to visit them on weekends. if you specify your location, members can suggest a lawyer around that area.

2. Always its the responsibility of the buyer to verify the documents and the authenticity of the property. Blindly trusting the lawyer of any Bank is not wise. 
Bank's have different set of criteria(official or unofficial) for giving loans to any projects. There are banks who sanction loans even for a fraud developers
